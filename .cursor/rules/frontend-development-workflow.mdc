# Frontend Development Workflow

## Getting Started
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd services/frontend
pnpm install
```

## Development Commands
All commands should be run from `services/frontend/` directory:

### Core Development
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server (usually runs on http://localhost:5173)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production (runs TypeScript check + Vite build)
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build locally

### Code Quality
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint on source files
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted

### Testing
- `pnpm test` - Run tests with Vitest
- `pnpm test:ui` - Run tests with interactive UI

## Development Server
- Default port: 5173 (may auto-increment if busy)
- Hot module replacement (HMR) enabled
- TypeScript errors show in both terminal and browser

## Build Process
1. **TypeScript check** - Ensures no type errors
2. **Vite build** - Bundles and optimizes for production
3. **Output** - Generated files go to `dist/` directory

## Code Style
- **TypeScript required** - All new files should be .ts or .tsx
- **Prettier formatting** - 150-character line length, single quotes, no semicolons
- **ESLint rules** - Modern flat config with TypeScript and React rules
